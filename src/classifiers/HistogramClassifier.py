# **Abstract base class for histogram classifying objects**  
# 
# Note that all concrete histogram classifiers must inherit from HistogramClassifier!
# A HistogramClassifier can be any object that classifies a histogram; in more detail:
# - the input is a collection of histograms (of the same type), represented by a numpy array of shape (nhists,nbins) for 1D histograms or (nhists,nybins,nxbins) for 2D histograms.
# - the output is an array of numbers of shape (nhists).
# - the processing between input and output can in principle be anything, but usually some sort of discriminating power is assumed.
# 
# How to make a concrete HistogramClassifier class:
# - define a class that inherits from HistogramClassifier
# - make sure all functions with @abstractmethod are implemented in your class
# - it is recommended to start each overriding function with a call to super(), but this is not strictly necessary
# 
# See also the existing examples!
