**Notebooks corresponding to source classes**

The notebooks in this folder are deprecated and should not be used anymore.  
They are fully equivalent to the regular python files one directory above and its subdirectories (on November 9, 2021).  

In the past, the usual workflow was to edit a .ipynb file and propagate these changes automatically to the corresponding .py file. However, as there is currently a full separation between files that can be imported (.py) and files that can run on SWAN (.ipynb), there is no need anymore for this duplication.  

Future updates (as of November 9, 2021) will be made directly to the .py files and not to the .ipynb files in this folder.  
They are only kept for reference and might be removed in future updates.
