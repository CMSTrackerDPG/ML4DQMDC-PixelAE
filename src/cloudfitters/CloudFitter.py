# **Abstract base class for all point cloud fitting algorithms** 
# 
# Note that all concrete point cloud fitters must inherit from CloudFitter!  
# 
# How to make a concrete CloudFitter class:
# - define a class that inherits from CloudFitter
# - make sure all functions with @abstractmethod are implemented in your class
# - it is recommended to start each overriding function with a call to super(), but this is not strictly necessary
# 
# See also the existing examples!
