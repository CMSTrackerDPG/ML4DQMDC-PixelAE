# GaussianKdeFitter  
  
**Class for fitting a gaussian kernel density to a point cloud**

Basically a wrapper for scipy.stats.gaussian_kde.  
A gaussian kernel density can be thought of as a sum of little (potentially multidimensional) gaussians, each one centered at one of the points in the cloud. Hence, the resulting distribution is a sort of smoothed version of the discrete point cloud.
